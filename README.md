# DVT Weather Test

DVT Android Test project built on MVVM architecture pattern, implementing the latest and greatest tools & libraries like Retrofit, Dagger Hilt, Coroutines, Room & Work Manager among other Jetpack Libraries.
It fetches data from [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

## Architecture
* A single-activity architecture, using the [Navigation Components](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) to manage fragment operations.
* Pattern [Model-View-ViewModel] - MVVM which facilitates a separation of development of the graphical user interface.
* [Android architecture components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/) which help to keep the application robust, testable, and maintainable.

## Technologies used:
* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) a REST Client for Android which makes it relatively easy to retrieve and upload JSON (or other structured data) via a REST based webservice.
* [Dagger Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) for dependency injection.
* [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.
* [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) to handle data in a lifecycle-aware fashion.
* [Navigation Component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) to handle all navigations and also passing of data between destinations.
* [Work Manager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager) to manage Android background jobs.
* [Material Design](https://material.io/develop/android/docs/getting-started/) an adaptable system of guidelines, components, and tools that support the best practices of user interface design.
* [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) used to manage the local storage i.e. `writing to and reading from the database`. Coroutines help in managing background threads and reduces the need for callbacks.
* [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/) to declaratively bind UI components in layouts to data sources.
* [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) persistence library which provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
* [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx) which helps to write more concise, idiomatic Kotlin code.

## Code style

To maintain the style and quality of the code, are used the bellow static analysis tools.

## Setup & Installation
Clone the repository.

You require the API `OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY` from [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/) to get data.
If you donâ€™t already have an account, create one in order to request an API Key.

Add the API and Base Url for [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/) in your `local.properties` file as shown then sync your project.

```properties
open.weather.key=YOUR_OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY
```


You can as well install the [test APK](https://github.com/zakayothuku/dvt-hiweather/blob/main/hiweather-test.apk) provided in the root folder for testing purposes.


## Missing Features
- Adding Favorite Locations & shows their Weather Forecast.
